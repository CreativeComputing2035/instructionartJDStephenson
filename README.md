Make a Twist Dog Balloon

1. Inflate a 260 balloon and leave about 4 inches uninflated in the tail end.
2. Fold the balloon about six inches from the nozzle end. Now part of the balloon will be sitting along side itself. 
3. Squeeze both parts of the folded balloon about 2 inches from the fold (where the arrows are in the diagram below). 
4. Now twist the balloon where you squeezed it. Twist it twice or three times until the twist holds in place. Notice that you've just made the ears of the dog (the short end with the knot and nozzle is the nose). 
5. The front and back legs are made the same way as the ears. Fold the balloon an inch below the twist that formed the ears. Now twist the balloon to form the front legs. 
6. Finally, fold the balloon 2 inches away from the twist that formed the front legs and twist. 
Voila! There's your little balloon puppy.
